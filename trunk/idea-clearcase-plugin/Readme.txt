Clearcase Plugin 1.36.0 for IDEA 5.0
====================================

The original ClearcasePlugin author is Jacques Morel
(http://www.intellij.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/JacquesMorel)

Jacques hasn't had any time to maintain the ClearcasePlugin recently. By the
time he realized this would be the case he was already too far into a serious
refactoring of the plugin source, which prevented him from publishing an
up-to-date version of the source.

In order to be able to maintain the plugin, I decompiled the latest available
version at the time (1.32) and rebuilt it several times for IDEA 5 EAPs. To
allow the community to contribute to the project, Jacques agreed to have these
'unofficial' sources published. This started with 1.33.1.

Please note that in the process of maintaining the plugin for IDEA 5.0,
Jacques' original sources suffered the loss of most (if not all) unit tests
and supporting classes and framework. You can blame me for this :-/
